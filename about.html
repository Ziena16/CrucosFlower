      <h4 class="groove"> The Cultural Significance of Crocus Flowers</h4>
    
      <blockquote>  
      Humans have been cultivating Crocus plants for over <em><b>3,000 years </b></em>now due to their value as a spice and dye source. With so many years of close contact with the plants, it’s no wonder it has become a potent source of symbolism for multiple cultures.
<br>
<em>Crocus Flower Symbolism in Minoan Art and Greek Mythology</em>
The earliest cultivation of saffron is recorded during the Minoan and Hittite empires in the Mediterranean and Middle East. These plants are commonly used as decorative motifs in art from this period, hinting at ritual importance. 
<br>
Frescos from this period show young girls almost always picking the flowers, linking the bloom to youth and joyfulness. In Greek culture, the flower became linked with mythology. The most common story includes a mortal man named Crocus who fell in love with a nymph. When the gods forbid them to marry, he died of sadness and was transformed into the flower. <br>
This gave Crocuses a strong romantic and devotional association. This made them a common symbol to see used to decorate ancient Greek weddings.

     <p> <br>
     <br>
<b>Perennial Gardens:</b> <br> Crocus bulbs are small and easy to tuck into flower beds. Plant them near the front edge when they’ll be easy to see. After blooming, the foliage will quickly fade away and make room for other plants.
 <br>
 <br>
 
 
<b>Rock Gardens:</b><br>Crocuses grow well in the spaces between rocks and in gravel gardens. With good drainage and warmth from nearby stones, they’ll bloom extra early. Plant a mix of species crocus and giant crocus to extend the show.
<br><br>


<b>Flowerbeds and Walkways:</b><br> Get your flower garden off to an early start by planting crocus along with other spring-blooming bulbs such as tulips, daffodils, muscari and hyacinths. Nestle a few crocus bulbs near the edge of a walkway, pathway or steps and enjoy their delicate blossoms every spring for years to come. 
  <br><br>

  
<b>Lawn and Landscape:</b><br> Get a jump on spring by planting crocus beneath trees and shrubs, or even right in the lawn. Crocus bulbs are small and only need to be planted about 3” deep, so it’s easy to plant a lot of them in a very short amount of time. They look best when planted in clumps or drifts, as they would be found growing in the wild. </p>
