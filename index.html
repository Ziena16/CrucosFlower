        <h2>A Flower Who Bloom In Winter</h2>
      
      
        <p> <b>Crocus</b> are among the very first flowers to bloom each spring. In cold climates, their cheery blossoms will often open when there's still snow on the ground. Crocus flowers come in Easter-egg colors of purple, yellow, lavender, cream and white. Over time, these carefree bulbs will naturalize and multiply to produce more flowers every year. Crocus blossoms are magnets for winter-weary bees, who are drawn to the rich, golden pollen inside each flower.
